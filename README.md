# MicroServices
This project is about MicroServices and it's best practices.
What is MicroServices and on what principle it's based on?
---
Microservices is an architecture design model with a specific bounded context, configuration, and dependencies. These result from the architectural principles of the domain-driven design and DevOps. Domain-driven design is the idea of solving problems of the organization through code.

The business goal is important to the business users, with a clear interface and functions. This way, the microservice can run independently from other microservices. Moreover, the team can also work on it independently, which is, in fact, the point of the microservice architecture.

<b> What is Domain Driven Design <b>
---
Eric Evans, introduced the concept in 2004, in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. According to the book, it focuses on three principles:

* The primary focus of the project is the core domain and domain logic.

* Complex designs are based on models of the domain.

* Collaboration between technical and domain experts is crucial to creating an application model that will solve particular domain problems.

 Advantages of Domain-Driven Design
 ---
* Simpler communication. Thanks to the Ubiquitous Language, communication between developers and teams becomes much easier. As the ubiquitous language is likely to contain simpler terms developers refer to, there’s no need for complicated technical terms.

* More flexibility. As DDD is object-oriented, everything about the domain is based on and object is modular and caged. Thanks to this, the entire system can be modified and improved regularly.

* The domain is more important than UI/UX. As the domain is the central concept, developers will build applications suited for the particular domain. This won’t be another interface-focused application. Although you shouldn’t leave out UX, using the DDD approach means that the product targets exactly the users that are directly connected to the domain.
